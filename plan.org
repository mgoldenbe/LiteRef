The plan is to develop LiteRef, a python daemon and an extension to org-ref that make things much more convenient and faster.

Since I would like to get to the actual literature survey as soon as possible, I am going to develop only the most important features and then continue development on the go. At some point, I may decide that the system is ripe enough to be sold.

* Features
** Daemon
*** DONE Automatic assignment of a descriptive key.
*** DONE A check whether the key already exists.
  + Remains to implement questioning the user whether the entry should be added in any case.
*** DONE Get rid of the proceeding/journal and the cross-reference.
*** DONE Splitting .bib file containing more than one entry into several files.
*** DONE Handling .csv files produced using Link Klipper
** org-ref-literef

**** DONE Reading bib entries from literef-directory.
**** DONE The new keys are in the clipboard.
