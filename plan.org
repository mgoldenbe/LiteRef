#+STARTUP: nologdone

The plan is to develop LiteRef, a python daemon and an extension to org-ref that make things much more convenient and faster.

Since I would like to get to the actual literature survey as soon as possible, I am going to develop only the most important features and then continue development on the go. At some point, I may decide that the system is ripe enough to be sold.

* Current issues
* Features
** Daemon
*** DONE Automatic assignment of a descriptive key.
*** DONE Splitting .bib file containing more than one entry into several files.
*** DONE A check whether the key already exists. Can apply the same action to the other entries in the new .bib file.
*** DONE The newly added keys are in the clipboard.
*** TODO Get rid of the proceeding/journal and the cross-reference.
**** TODO Update this feature, so this is done before asking whether to apply choice (in the case of repeated key) for remaining entries.
*** DONE Handling .csv files produced using Link Klipper
Currently only from DBLP.
*** DONE Handling of request to download PDF. Sources are configurable. Automated download with fall-back on manual. 
*** DONE Venue query.
** org-ref-literef
*** DONE Constant bib entry look-up (for whatever purpose) based on key.
*** DONE Inserting a citation. This computes the list of .bib files.
*** DONE Following citation by going to the right notes file.
*** DONE Opening and getting PDF from citation or notes/bib file.
*** DONE Splitting citations. The special characters are correctly handled. 
*** DONE Command to put /current/ key into clipboard. 
*** DONE Intelligent yanking.
*** DONE Search for pdfs based on string, e.g. "Toronto". Search based on the contents of the first page.
*** DONE Export without the need for specifying bibliography files.
*** DONE Export with notes
**** Requirements
When =literef-export-with-notes= is enabled:
- The non-empty notes for each cited paper is included in the export.
- Each paperâ€™s notes becomes a sub-section in the section with the notes. The exported file itself becomes a section as well.
- Each citation is accompanied by section reference.
- When =literef-export-with-notes-recursive= is enabled, the papers cited in the notes are included and treated just like those in the exported file itself. This is done recursively. When =literef-export-with-notes-depth= is not =nil=, the depth of the recursion is limited.
- Narrowing to any level of sub-tree is correctly handled.
- A section may or may not be created for the exported buffer. Not creating a section is particularly useful when one wants to join several files by using INCLUDE. 
*** DONE Annotation of citations.
*** TODO Commands related to annotations:
**** TODO All papers for which the current paper is a background.
**** TODO All background papers of a given paper.
