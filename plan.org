The plan is to develop LiteRef, a python daemon and an extension to org-ref that make things much more convenient and faster.

Since I would like to get to the actual literature survey as soon as possible, I am going to develop only the most important features and then continue development on the go. At some point, I may decide that the system is ripe enough to be sold.

* Features
** Daemon
*** DONE Automatic assignment of a descriptive key.
*** DONE Splitting .bib file containing more than one entry into several files.
*** DONE A check whether the key already exists. Can apply the same action to the other entries in the new .bib file.
*** DONE The newly added keys are in the clipboard.
*** TODO Get rid of the proceeding/journal and the cross-reference.
**** TODO Update this feature, so this is done before asking whether to apply choice (in the case of repeated key) for remaining entries.
*** DONE Handling .csv files produced using Link Klipper
Currently only from DBLP.
*** DONE Handling of request to download PDF. Sources are configurable. Automated download with fall-back on manual. 
** org-ref-literef
*** DONE Inserting a citation.
*** TODO Following citation by going to the right notes file.
This needs to work as soon as the paper is added, so no re-reading of sources should be required.
*** DONE Opening and getting PDF from citation or notes/bib file.
*** TODO Export without the need for specifying bibliography files.
*** TODO Latex Total export: each paper’s notes become a section, citations accompanied by section reference.
*** TODO HTML Total export: each paper’s notes become a section, citations accompanied by section reference.
*** TODO Annotation of citations.
*** TODO Commands related to annotations:
**** TODO All papers for which the current paper is a background.
**** TODO All background papers of a given paper.
*** TODO Command to put current paper into clipboard.
